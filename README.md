# MicroWakeWord Models

Homeassistant Voice uses on-device models. By default there are a few famous models available, e.g. Alexa, Mycroft oder Okay Nabu.

To have a bit more choice this repo contains a few more models that can be integrated. These models have been trained using [MicroWakeWord-Trainer-Docker](https://github.com/MasterPhooey/). 

## How to use the models

Install the default firmware on your Homeassistant Voice PE or your ESP32 S3 Box 3.

Then take over control via esphome.

The models from this repo can be added to the configuration as follows: 

```yaml
micro_wake_word:
  models:
    - model: github://peteh/micro-wake-word-custom-models/models/terminator.json
```

A full configuration could look like this (Example: ESP32 S3 Box 3 based on Homeassistant's standard firmware):

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: esp32-s3-box-3-05bccc
  friendly_name: ESP Assist
